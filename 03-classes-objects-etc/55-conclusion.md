# summary

- introduction of OOP / Object Oriented Programming
  - classes
  - objects
- core building blocks of class
  - variables
  - methods
  - constructors
- 1st data structure
  - array

# Object oriented programming

- model real-world scenarios in a natural way
- `object` - real-world entity
  - student
- Objects are defined by `class`

# Variables

- container that holds something
- Java is `statically-typed` language
  - once typed, no other type of data
    - called static type
- variables
  - primitive
  - object references
- 8 primitives
- variable kinds
  - instance
    - state
  - static
    - shared across all objects of class
  - local
    - variables defined inside methods and constructors

# Arrays

- array is object
- stores `fixed numbers` of `single type` elements
- support fast random access
  - access constant time, O(1)

# Methods

- define behavior
- Java is always pass by value
- to overload, parameter list MUST be different

# constructors

- runs on object creation
- initialize `object state`
- `this`
  - invoke overloaded constructor
  - MUST be constructor's first statement
