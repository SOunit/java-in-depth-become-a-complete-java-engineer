# Java API

- library of well-tested classes
- Java8 has 4240 classes
- developed by exports
- used by million of programmers
- part of both JDK & JRE

# Packages

- java.lang
  - String
  - Class
  - Object
- java.util
  - ArrayList
  - HashMap
- java.io
  - File
  - BufferedReader

# Why packages?

- meaningful organization
  - `java.util` is for data-structure
- name scoping
  - `java.util.Date` != `Java.sql.Date`
- security
  - access limit from outside the package

# Java API: Import packages

- `java.lang`
  - fundamental classes
